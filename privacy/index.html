  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 13, 2026</p>

  <section>
    <p>
      Muhannad Jaber ("we", "us", "our") built Quran Pulse as a free, non-commercial mobile application 
      to help users connect with the Quran. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle any information when 
      you use the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information. 
      The app is designed to work with minimal data and respects your privacy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect only the following non-personal data, and only when needed for app functionality:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Location data</strong> (city or coordinates) – used temporarily to provide accurate prayer times. This data is never stored on our servers or shared with third parties beyond the APIs listed below.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage preferences</strong> – such as selected reciter, dark mode, notification toggles, and bookmarks. This data is stored locally on your device using AsyncStorage and never leaves your phone.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name, email, phone number, or any personal identifiers</li>
      <li>Payment information (the app is completely free)</li>
      <li>Device IDs, advertising IDs, or analytics data</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Location is used only in real-time to fetch prayer times (via Aladhan API). It is discarded immediately after use.</li>
      <li>Local preferences (reciter, bookmarks, etc.) are saved on your device to improve your experience and persist across app sessions.</li>
      <li>No data is used for advertising, profiling, marketing, or any commercial purpose.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app relies on the following external APIs. They may collect minimal, anonymized data as per their own policies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Aladhan API</strong>[](https://aladhan.com) – provides prayer times, and Islamic calendar data. See their privacy policy: https://aladhan.com/privacy-policy</li>
      <li><strong>Hadith API</strong>[](https://hadithapi.com) – provides random Hadith of the Day. No personal data is sent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not have access to any data these services collect from your requests.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Notifications (Athan Alerts)</h2>
    <p>
      The app uses Expo Notifications to play Athan audio at prayer times (even when the app is closed or the phone is locked). 
      Notifications are scheduled locally on your device — no personal data is sent to any server.
    </p>
    <p>You can disable any prayer notification at any time from within the app.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data Storage & Security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All user preferences and bookmarks are stored locally on your device only.</li>
      <li>No data is transmitted to us or any server we control.</li>
      <li>We do not have access to your device storage or personal information.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here and the "Last updated" date will be revised. 
      Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>
